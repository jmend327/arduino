/*
 * Ultrasonic Simple
 * Prints the distance read by an ultrasonic sensor in
 * centimeters. They are supported to four pins ultrasound
 * sensors (liek HC-SC04) and three pins (like PING)))
 * and Seeed Studio sesores).
 *
 * The circuit:
 * * Module HR-SC04 (four pins) or PING))) (and other with
 *   three pins), attached to digital pins as follows:
 * ---------------------    ---------------------
 * | HC-SC04 | Arduino |    | 3 pins  | Arduino |
 * ---------------------    ---------------------
 * |   Vcc   |   5V    |    |   Vcc   |   5V    |
 * |   Trig  |   12    | OR |   SIG   |   13    |
 * |   Echo  |   13    |    |   Gnd   |   GND   |
 * |   Gnd   |   GND   |    ---------------------
 * ---------------------
 * Note: You need not obligatorily use the pins defined above
 * 
 * By default, the distance returned by the distanceRead()
 * method is in centimeters, to get the distance in inches,
 * pass INC as a parameter.
 * Example: ultrasonic.distanceRead(INC)
